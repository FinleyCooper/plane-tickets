# Evaluation
Overall all of the objectives made in the Analysis have been achieved successfully. However there could still be improvements to be made.  
Calling the endpoint on a plane which doesn't exist will return a 5xx response code  
The code may be vunrable to SQL injection hacks  
The API could have been paired with a front end Web App which would have provided a much easier UI for the user to interact with. 

In conclusion I call the NEA in 8 hours project a success. I spent around 4 hours programming, 2 hours testing and bug fixing and just over an hour writing the report up, for a total of just over 7 hours, much less than the 50 hours recommended by AQA, and ontop on me not have even started the A level course.  

Thanks for taking your time to read the report,
